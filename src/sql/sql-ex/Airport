The database schema consists of 4 tables:
Company(ID_comp, name)
Trip(trip_no, id_comp, plane, town_from, town_to, time_out, time_in)
Passenger(ID_psg, name)
Pass_in_trip(trip_no, date, ID_psg, place)

The Company table contains IDs and names of the airlines transporting passengers.
The Trip table contains information on the schedule of flights:
trip (flight) number,
company (airline) ID,
plane type,
departure city,
destination city,
departure time, and arrival time.

The Passenger table holds IDs and names of the passengers.

The Pass_in_trip table contains data on flight bookings:
trip number,
departure date (day),
passenger ID
and her seat (place) designation during the flight.

It should be noted that
- scheduled flights are operated daily; the duration of any flight is less than 24 hours; town_from <> town_to;
- all time and date values are assumed to belong to the same time zone;
- departure and arrival times are specified with one minute precision;
- there can be several passengers bearing the same first name and surname (for example, Bruce Willis);
- the seat (place) designation consists of a number followed by a letter; the number stands for the row, while the letter (a â€“ d) defines the seat position in the grid (from left to right, in alphabetical order;
- connections and constraints are shown in the database schema below.



#63
Find the names of different passengers
that ever travelled more than once occupying seats with the same number.

select name from passenger
where id_psg in (
    select id_psg from pass_in_trip
    group by place, id_psg
    having count(place) > 1)


#67
Find out the number of routes with the greatest number of flights (trips).
Notes.
1) A - B and B - A are to be considered DIFFERENT routes.
2) Use the Trip table only.

with q as
(select count(*) as c from trip
group by town_from, town_to)

select count(*) from q
where c = (select max(c) from q)


#68
Find out the number of routes with the greatest number of flights (trips).
Notes.
1) A - B and B - A are to be considered the SAME route.
2) Use the Trip table only.

with q as (
select count(*) as c from trip
group by
 case
 when town_from > town_to
 then town_from else town_to
end,
 case
 when town_from < town_to
 then town_from else town_to
end)

select count(*) from q
where c = (select max(c) from q)


#72

Among the customers using a single airline, find distinct passengers who have flown most frequently.
Result set: passenger name, number of trips.

    select id_psg, count(t.trip_no) as trip_count, count(distinct id_comp) as comp_count
    from pass_in_trip pit

    select id_psg from T
    where trip_count = (select max(trip_count) from T)
    )


#77
Find the days with the maximum number of flights departed from Rostov.
Result set: number of trips, date.

with T as (
    select count(distinct t.trip_no) as qty, date from trip t
    join pass_in_trip pit
    on t.trip_no = pit.trip_no
    where town_from = 'rostov'

select qty, date from T
where qty = (select max(qty) from T)




#84
For each airline, calculate the number of passengers carried in April 2003 (if there were any)
by ten-day periods. Consider only flights that departed that month.
Result set: company name, number of passengers carried for each ten-day period.

select c.name,
count(case when day(date) > 10 then null else day(date) end) as '1-10',
count(case when day(date) < 11 or day(date) > 20 then null else day(date) end) as '11-20',

group by c.name



#88
Among those flying with a single airline find the names of different passengers who have flown most often.
Result set: passenger name, number of trips, and airline name.

with T as (
select pt.id_psg, count(pt.trip_no) as trip_count, max(id_comp) as id_comp from pass_in_trip pt
join trip t
on t.trip_no = pt.trip_no
group by pt.id_psg
having count(distinct id_comp) = 1
)

select p.name, trip_count, c.name from T
join passenger p
on p.id_psg = T.id_psg
join company c
on c.id_comp = T.id_comp
where trip_count = (select max(trip_count) from T)



#95
Using the Pass_in_Trip table, calculate for each airline:
1) the number of performed flights;
2) the number of plane types used;
3) the number of different passengers that have been transported;
4) the total number of passengers that have been transported by the company.
Output: airline name, 1), 2), 3), 4).
