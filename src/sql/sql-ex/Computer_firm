--The database scheme consists of four tables:
--Product(maker, model, type)
--PC(code, model, speed, ram, hd, cd, price)
--Laptop(code, model, speed, ram, hd, screen, price)
--Printer(code, model, color, type, price)
--The Product table contains data on the maker, model number,
-- and type of product ('PC', 'Laptop', or 'Printer').
-- It is assumed that model numbers in the Product table are unique for all makers and product types.
-- Each personal computer in the PC table is unambiguously identified by a unique code,
-- and is additionally characterized by its model (foreign key referring to the Product table),
-- processor speed (in MHz) – speed field, RAM capacity (in Mb) - ram, hard disk drive capacity
-- (in Gb) – hd, CD-ROM speed (e.g, '4x') - cd, and its price. The Laptop table is similar to the PC
-- table, except that instead of the CD-ROM speed, it contains the screen size (in inches) – screen.
-- For each printer model in the Printer table, its output type (‘y’ for color and ‘n’ for monochrome) – color
-- field, printing technology ('Laser', 'Jet', or 'Matrix') – type, and price are specified.
